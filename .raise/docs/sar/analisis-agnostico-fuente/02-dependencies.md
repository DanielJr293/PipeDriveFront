# Dependencies and Collaborations

This document outlines the external and infrastructure dependencies of the Raise-Gemini MCP Server.

## Egress Dependencies

No external services (e.g., REST APIs, databases) are directly called from the application logic. The application's primary function is to build prompts for the Gemini CLI, which then handles the communication with the Google AI services.

## Infrastructure Dependencies

### Python Libraries (`requirements.txt`)

-   **fastapi:** A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
    -   **Purpose:** Used to create the web server that exposes the MCP tools.
-   **uvicorn:** An ASGI server implementation, for running the FastAPI application.
    -   **Purpose:** The web server that runs the FastAPI application.
-   **fastmcp:** A framework for building Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) servers.
    -   **Purpose:** The core framework used to define and manage the MCP tools.

### File System

The application has a strong dependency on the local file system for its operation. This is managed primarily through the `prompt_utils.py` module.

-   **Prompt Templates:** The server reads prompt templates from the `src/prompts/` directory. These templates are the basis for the prompts generated by the tools.
-   **Context Files:** The tools receive a list of file paths (`rutas_contexto`) as arguments. The content of these files is not read by the server, but passed to the Gemini CLI, which then reads them.
-   **RaiSE Methodology Documents:** The server reads various documents from the `.raise/` directory, including Katas, templates, and rules, to provide context and guidance within the generated prompts.
